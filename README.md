# Gender-Classification
Gender Classification of Speech Signals

Notes
--------
This is a small pyTorch project. My initial aim was classifiy speech signals according to frequency features and practice python. So far models' accuracy is 73 percent. 

1. Use a database consist of both genders.
   - Ex: Lombard_Speech_Database_German
   
2. You may run pre-processing.py to arrange files.

3. Put enough speech samples into a folder 'testset'.

4. Run: main.py
