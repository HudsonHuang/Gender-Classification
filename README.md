Gender Classification of Speech Signals

Notes
--------
This is a simple PyTorch project. Model can classify clean speech signals according to frequency features with 100 percent accuracy.


I'm using small subset of 16kHz McGill and VCTK clean speech databases consist of equal number of female and male English speakers. Databases can be found here: http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/Data/
