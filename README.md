Gender Classification of Speech Signals

Notes
--------
This is a small PyTorch project. My initial aim was classifiy speech signals according to frequency features. 

So far models' accuracy is 91 percent in 137 test sample.

I'm using ~1h length McGill speech database 16k-LP7 consist of equal number of female and male English speakers. Database can be found here: http://www-mmsp.ece.mcgill.ca/Documents/Data/
