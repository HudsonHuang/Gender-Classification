Gender Classification of Speech Signals

Notes
--------
This is a small PyTorch project. My initial aim was classifiy speech signals according to frequency features and practice python. 

What I've done so far is basicly taking the speech signal and classificy whether speaker is male or female. So far models' accuracy is 94 percent in 86 test sample.
